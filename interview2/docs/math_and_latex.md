# Math & LaTeX Support

Acme Tutor supports **LaTeX** input for equations. The tutor can **read equations aloud with math speech rules** to aid accessibility.

## Examples
- `\frac{a}{b}` → "a over b"
- `\sqrt{x}` → "square root of x"
- `a^2 + b^2 = c^2` → "a squared plus b squared equals c squared"
- `\times` → "times"

## Hints
- The tutor offers **hints before full solutions**, encouraging students to attempt intermediate steps.
- Practice sets are **aligned to Common Core** standards.

## Limitations
- Complex multi-line derivations may be summarized for concision.
