# Onboarding Guide

## Account Creation
Students can create an account with **email or SSO** (Google, Microsoft). A parent/guardian consent step is presented for students under 13.

## Diagnostic
After signup, a **diagnostic quiz** calibrates initial mastery for each subject. The quiz typically contains **15 questions** and takes around **10 minutes**.

## Session Flow
Each session starts with a **learning goal**. The tutor adjusts **difficulty after each session based on mastery gains**. If a student struggles, the system inserts **remedial subskills** before proceeding.

## Data Retention (Student View)
Students can view their last **30 days** of session transcripts. Older logs are not visible in the student portal (see privacy policy for server-side retention).

## Classroom Join Codes
Teachers can create classes and share **6-character join codes** with students.
